  # There are combinations of features that are only available with certain

  # See the providers and features blurb in the above link for valid combntns
  # our use case, probably, is within the 'standard' provider.
  # All the magic happens in the f5_virtualserver type
  # We are only passing the options via hiera via create_resources
